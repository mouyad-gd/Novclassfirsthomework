## Hello world!

* This project was designed for a homework assignment for CWRU - Full-Stack bootcamp.
* This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link. Or, download the sources files to use this as a template.
* I have a passion for learning new HTML and SCC skills. 

* Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

Code Refactor is important practice for early learning HTML and CSS, the ultimate goal of this project is to get familiar with cleaning, organizing and structuring codes, the goal is to help other developers go through the files easily and understand how it was built.
